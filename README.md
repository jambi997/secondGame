# secondGame
this is the second game I worked on.  Development finished 2021 april, toke around 2-3 months

you can try it here : https://jambi997.github.io/secondGame/

The game has a save and load function on the start screen, to save your inventory.

Clicking on start will takes us to the inventory, where we can gear up our 5 characters. Clicking on placing we can drag their icons onto the battlefield, and that will be their starting position. The menu button will take you back to the start menu where you can save and load.

dragging items into the red square will delete them from the inventory. hovering you mouse above items will show their stats. The go fight button will take us to a battle, where our characters will fight all kinds of creatures, and if they are succesfull a gate will open and they will walk in to go to the next level. If they fail we can click on the loot button to get to the loot screen, where we can choose what items to take home. The number and quality of the items is dependent on how far our crew got. Dragging items into the brown squere will drop them into our inventory, loot all button will take all the items to our inventory, loot green will take the green and blue items, and the loot blue will take only the blue items. Finish adventure takes us back to the inventory

While in the game everything fights on its own, and we cant really interact with it, they choose their target based on a stat called threath. Its calculated with stats from items and the damage dealt.
